__Independent Project to implement H-Minimax search with alpha-beta pruning in Ruby__
* H-minimax h depth parameter set at the top of program
* Command-line based checkers game. User plays as white, agent plays as black
* If both teams are left with one peice left, and there is no immediate capture, game ends in a draw
* It is a rule of checkers that player must make the longest capture available at every point in the game

* I plan on implementing this graphically in Rails, in an effort to better learn the framework, but I do not have time at the moment with the semester underway
